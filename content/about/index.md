Hello! I’m Kanishk Ingle, hailing from the picturesque town of Sangli in Maharashtra.

Growing up in a humble family, my fascination with engineering marvels was ignited at a young age. My curiosity deepened when I first laid my hands on a PC, captivated by the boundless possibilities of software and its potential to transform our world.

Driven by this passion, I pursued higher education in Computer Science. I earned my Master’s degree from the prestigious [National Institute of Technology, Goa](https://www.nitgoa.ac.in/), specializing in Blockchain and Security (2020-22). My undergraduate journey began at [Shivaji University, Kolhapur](https://www.unishivaji.ac.in/), where I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering.

My journey has been fueled by a relentless quest for knowledge and a passion for technology’s transformative power.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
